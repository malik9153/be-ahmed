# Rated Restaurants

## A micro [yelp](https://www.yelp.co.uk/c/manchester/restaurants) clone API using Express and SQL

### Background

We are going to build an API which shows ratings and cuisine for restaurants in the North.
For this Sprint we will be using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

### W3 Schools

When we are looking for in depth knowledge on JavaScript we tend to use MDN - W3 Schools is a very good resource for referencing and learning SQL. [Here is the link](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)

## Seeding

There is a file in the `db` folder for seeding both a dev and a test database. You can run these directly with `psql` and for the dev database we have provided the following script in your package.json: `npm run seed-dev`

### Tables

Both of the databases share the following table setup:

#### Areas Table

| area_id            | name    |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | VARCHAR |

Areas `have many` Restaurants (see below)

#### Restaurants Table

| restaurant_id      | name    | area_id                  | cuisine | website |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | VARCHAR | INT REFERENCES Areas(id) | VARCHAR | VARCHAR |

Restaurants `have many` Ratings (see below)

#### Ratings Table

The rating must be an integer with a minimum value of one and a maximum value of five.

| rating_id          | restaurant_id                  | rating  | created_at                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | INT REFERENCES Restaurants(id) | INTEGER | TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |

A rating does not need to know which Area the Restaurant it `belongs to` is in.

## Creating the connection to the separate `test` and `development` databases

**Database connection setup:** Your first task is to create your connection to the database using `node-postgres`.

You will need to create a connection to the relevant database in a `./db/index.js` file, and use `dotenv` files (`.env.test` & `.env.development`) to determine which database to connect to, based on whether you are running your `jest` tests, or running the server manually.

> _`dotenv` is a [module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the `process.env` global object](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme)_

## API challenges

Now that we have our connection to our databases containing our data, we can start to build our server to interact with our data.

**Test setup:** The next thing to do is to update the `"test"` script in the `package.json` file, so that it will seed the data and then run the tests using `jest`. [This Stack Overflow answer will be helpful!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4510640/what-is-the-purpose-of-in-a-shell-command)

For each of the following endpoints, first write a test using `supertest` and then implement the endpoint.

**After your lecture on Day 2, make sure to go back to previous endpoints and add any error handling you can think of - testing first and then implementing.**

### 1. GET /api

This endpoint should respondcontaining  with a json object a 'message' key.

_Note: you do **not** need a model function for this endpoint, as we are not interacting with the database!_

```js
{
  "message": "all ok"
}
```

### 2. GET /api/restaurants

This endpoint should respond with a json object containing a key of `restaurants` with a value of an array of all the restaurant objects.

E.g.

```js
{
  "restaurants": [
    // ... restaurant objects
  ]
}
```

### 3. POST /api/restaurants

This endpoint should add a restaurant to the database and respond with newly created restaurant

```js
// POST /api/restaurants - example request body:

{
  "restaurant_name": "The Codfather",
  "area_id": 2,
  "cuisine": "British",
  "website": "www.thecodfather.com"
};
```

```js
// Example response:
{
  "restaurant": {
    "restaurant_id": 9,
    "restaurant_name": "The Codfather",
    "area_id": 2,
    "cuisine": "British",
    "website": "www.thecodfather.com"
  }
}
```

### 4. DELETE /api/restaurants/:restaurant_id

This endpoint should delete the specified restaurant from the database and respond with a 204 No Content status.

### 5. PATCH /api/restaurants/:restaurant_id

This endpoint should be able to update the `area_id` field of the specified restaurant. It should respond with the updated restaurant object. Extra/invalid keys in the request object should be ignored, but an empty object in the request should get a 400 response.

```js
// PATCH /api/restaurants/3 - example request body:

{
  "area_id": 2 // <--- was previously area_id 3 for this restaurant
};
```

```js
// Example response:
{
  "restaurant": {
    "restaurant_id": 3,
    "restaurant_name": "Rudys Pizza",
    "area_id": 2,
    "cuisine": "Neapolitan Pizzeria",
    "website": "http://rudyspizza.co.uk/"
  }
}
```

### 6. GET /api/areas/:area_id/restaurants

This endpoint should respond with a json object with the area details, containing a count of the restaurants in that area and an array of those restaurants.

```js
// GET /api/areas/1/restaurants
{
  "area": {
    "area_id": 1,
    "name": "Northern Quarter",
    "total_restaurants": 4,
    "restaurants": [
      //  ... area 1 restaurants
    ]
  }
}
```

### 7. GET /api/restaurants

Update the existing endpoint so that each restaurant object has an `average_rating` property.

## Even More Challenges

### 8. GET /api/restaurants?search=**searchTerm**

Update the above endpoint to allow a `search` query which will filter the results for any restaurant names that match, or partially match, the search term.

**Hint:** - Implement this filtering in your SQL query rather than JavaScript.

E.g.

```js
// GET /api/restaurants?search=pi
{
  "restaurants": [
    // Rudys Pizza restaurant object,
    // Pieminister restaurant object
  ]
}
```

### 9. PATCH /api/restaurants/:restaurant_id

Update this endpoint so that multiple valid keys could be provided and all of those fields get updated.

```js
// PATCH /api/restaurants/5 - example request body:
{
 "website": "http://updatedWebsite.co.uk/",
 "area_id": 2 // <--- was area_id 1
};
```

```js
// Example response:
{
  "restaurant": {
    "restaurant_id": 5,
    "restaurant_name": "Pieminister",
    "area_id": 2,
    "cuisine": "Pies and More Pies",
    "website": "http://updatedWebsite.co.uk/"
  }
}
```

### 10. GET /api/restaurants?sort_by=**sortByCriteria**

This endpoint should be able to take a sort_by query that will sort the restaurants by the specified criteria, including rating. If no sort_by is specified, the sort should default to sorted alphabetically by name, descending.

```js
// GET /api/restaurants?sort_by=rating
{
  "restaurants": [
    // restaurant objects sorted by rating, descending order
  ]
}
```
